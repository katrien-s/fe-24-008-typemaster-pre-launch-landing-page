### Useful resources

- [Breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/) - I saw it mentioned by Jes Chan in one of her YouTube video's by [Coder Coder](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCoderCoder) that she uses these Bootstrap-breakpoints setting, in order to have a smooth transition the responsive layout across device or viewport sizes. I took inspiration here to set my media-queries.
