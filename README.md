## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I began this exercise a long time ago. I've refactored the css going from entire class-based styling to using more variables and custom properties.
There was a long search on how to do the full bleed properly. Which I've learned now thanks to the tutorial [How to make full bleed wrappers with CSS grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l24PIccgqU) provided by [Coder Coder](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCoderCoder). This allowed me to have the images or gray squares, run off the page.


### Useful resources

- [Breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/) - I saw it mentioned by Jes Chan in one of her YouTube video's by [Coder Coder](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCoderCoder) that she uses these Bootstrap-breakpoints setting, in order to have a smooth transition the responsive layout across device or viewport sizes. I took inspiration here to set my media-queries.
